I am a computer science graduate student in the University of British Columbia (UBC). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Nanjing University, majoring in Information Management and Information System. I used to be a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia, supervised by [Yeye He](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yeyehe/) and [Weiwei Cui](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weiweicu/). I also spent my summer in 2021 as a research assistant at Simon Fraser University, working on [DataPrep Project](https://dataprep.ai/) (remotely). My full resume can be found [here](https://noirtree.github.io/files/CV_jingxuan.pdf).

Generally speaking, my research interest lies in **Data Management and Data Mining**. I'm specifically interested in how people interact with data and how we can improve that process.

Note: Feel free to call me **Carol** if you find it hard to pronounce my Chinese name :)
