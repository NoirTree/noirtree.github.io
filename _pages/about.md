I am an undergraduate in Nanjing University, majoring in Information System. Currently, I'm a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia. Before that, I spent my summer break 2021 as a research assistant in Simon Fraser University, working on [DataPrep Project](https://dataprep.ai/) (remotely).

Generally speaking, my research interest lies in **Data Management and Data Mining**. These days, I'm dedicated to developing useful tools for data scientists.

Note: Feel free to call me **Carol** if you find it hard to pronounce my Chinese name :)
